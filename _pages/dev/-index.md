# How to get started with libGDX?
libGDX offers a [setup tool](/dev/project_generation/), which automatically creates a project and downloads everything necessary.
{: .notice--primary}

Please take a look at our **[Setup Instructions](/dev/setup/)** to get started. These walk you through the process of **creating your very first libGDX project** using our setup tool. To get started with developing, take a look at our post **[A Simple Game](/dev/simple_game/)**, a short tutorial aiding your first steps.

<br/>

# Documentation
The libGDX codebase is documented in two ways:
- In our [Wiki](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki)
- And via [Javadocs](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/ci/nightlies/docs/api/)

<br/>

# Tools & Libraries
There are different tools and libraries that make the development process for libGDX easier. See our **[Tools List](/dev/tools/)** for some of the most commonly used tools.

A curated list of our favourite libraries can be found at **[Awesome-libGDX](https://github.com/rafaskb/awesome-libgdx#readme)**. On our Discord server we also have an extensive collection of libGDX-centered libraries that are currently work in progress.

<br/>

# Contributing to libGDX
Contributing to libGDX can come in a few different forms: you can [report issues](/dev/issues/), help out on our [Discord](/community/), pledge to the [Patreon page](/funding/), or [submit code and documentation back to the project](/dev/contributing/) on GitHub.

If you want to contribute to the code base of libGDX, please review our [contributing guidelines](/dev/contributing/). After that, you need to get libGDX set up on your local machine. Instructions for that can be found [here](/dev/from_source/).
